Just got out of seeing Chhaava and boy, my brain’s doing cartwheels trying to process this one. You ever watch a movie and feel like you’ve just run a marathon? Not the good kind where you reach the finish line with your hands in the air, but the kind where you’re just relieved it's freakin’ over. That’s Chhaava. A rollercoaster that sometimes feels more like a ride on the world’s longest escalator — you’re moving, but are you really going anywhere? 

First off, I gotta say, the visuals were like a burst of bright paint splattered on a drab wall. You walk in expecting the usual slow drizzle of cinema, and instead, you get hit by a technicolor tsunami. Seriously, the color grading? Top notch. But honestly, I felt like I had pop rocks in my eyes after two hours. And the soundtrack was this mix of soul-thumping beats and whispered melodies that might just haunt my dreams tonight. It’s like they took a strainer to the music of the gods and only let the catchy bits through.

> The story though, man, it zigzagged through plots like a toddler on sugar high. At times gripping, at times confusing—kind of like when you open Twitter and try to understand why that one cat meme is trending again. And the protagonist, he’s there wielding more internal conflict than a philosopher deciding on extra guac at Chipotle. The charm tried so hard, you almost wanna pat it on the shoulder and say, “It’s okay, buddy, we get it.”

I couldn’t decide if I was on board with the dialogue or if I needed a map and a compass to navigate it. Some parts felt like they’d lifted Shakespeare and thrown it in a blender with Bollywood. Others were crisp and witty enough to believe someone might actually say them—not that anyone would download the movie for those seconds alone, though.

        return eh, worth a watch with popcorn

But here's the kicker, I’d actually sneak back and watch again—or maybe just download the movie for that one epic scene where everything finally made sense. And the sheer audacity of the climax! It left me with a crooked grin like your mischievous cat knocking things off the table while keeping direct eye contact.

Bottom line: Chhaava—it’s not the kind of movie you casually discuss over Sunday brunch. But it’s the sort that wriggles under your skin and has you mumbling about it to yourself during random moments throughout the next day. I’m tired, I’m skeptical, but most of all, strangely satisfied.
